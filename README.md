Part 1 is implementing gradient descent without using sklearn
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, random, sklearn, matplotlib
To Run Code:
  1. Navigate to file in IDE after downloading
  2. Have pip installed if not already
  3. Install the necessary libraries
  3. Type [python version] part1.py. EX: python3 part1.py
  4. Change parameters to see different values 
    (default is set at learning rate = 0.001 and iterations = 10000)
    Uncomment Code at bottom to see various graphs
